## Full code coverage

Front- and back-end coverage for this application is collected using the [@cypress/code-coverage](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage) plugin. You can run the locally instrumented server and client using `npm run dev:coverage` command. The backend coverage is exposed in [server/server/index.js](server/server/index.js) via endpoint listed in [cypress.json](cypress.json) (usually `GET /__coverage`). The frontend coverage is collected by instrumenting the web application source code on the fly, see the [client/.babelrc](client/.babelrc) file.

The combined report is saved in `coverage/index.html` after the tests finish:

The coverage is sent to [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/cypress-io/cypress-example-realworld) using command `npm run coveralls` from CircleCI.
