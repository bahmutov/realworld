## Full code coverage

Is collected using [@cypress/code-coverage](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage). We run locally instrumented server and client using `npm run dev:coverage`, backend coverage is exposed in [server/server/index.js](server/server/index.js) via endpoint listed in [cypress.json](cypress.json). Frontend coverage is collected by instrumenting source code on the fly, see [client/.babelrc](client/.babelrc) file.

Combined report is saved in `coverage/index.html`
